## §1 — Shell scripts: bash assumptions, quoting through layers

The single highest-incident category. 4 separate prod-impacting bugs in Suna, all in code
that constructs shell commands and runs them through `docker exec` or `ssh`.

### §1.1 — `set -o pipefail` is bash-only; `/bin/sh` is dash on Debian/Ubuntu

```sh
# WRONG — Suna shipped this; dash exits 'Illegal option -o pipefail' (exit 2)
# Combined with a 20-retry × 5s loop = ~100s frontend hang before erroring.
sh -c 'set -eu -o pipefail; ...'

# RIGHT
sh -c 'set -eu; ...'    # if no real pipes, just drop it
```

Apply: any script that ships to the VPS host. The VPS is Ubuntu/Debian; `/bin/sh` is dash.

### §1.2 — Multi-line scripts joined with `; `

```sh
# WRONG — Suna shipped this; produces 'for i in ...; do;  systemctl ...' which is invalid syntax
const recovery = [
  'for i in 1 2 3',
  'do',
  '  systemctl restart foo',
  'done',
].join('; ');

# RIGHT — use real newlines (in a Bash here-doc or template literal with \n)
const recovery = `for i in 1 2 3; do
  systemctl restart foo
done`;
```

The `do;` empty statement is the giveaway. Test the joined string in a shell before shipping.

### §1.3 — Quoting through `sh -lc` → host vs container confusion

The killer bug. When you write a Node/TS template literal containing `"` to pass to
`sh -lc "..."` over `docker exec`, the `"` characters break the outer quoting, and `$(...)`
inside expands on the **wrong layer** (host instead of container).

```ts
// WRONG — Suna's verifyPublicKeyViaHostExec used \" inside the template:
const cmd = `docker exec ${id} sh -lc "test \"$(stat -c %a /file)\" = \"600\""`;
// → host shell sees: sh -lc "test  = 600" (busted quoting, $(stat) ran on the HOST)
// → host doesn't have /file → 'stat: cannot statx' → test fails with '=: unexpected operator'

// RIGHT — single-quote the inner command so $(...) survives to the container shell:
const cmd = `docker exec ${id} sh -lc 'test "x$(stat -c %a /file)" = "x600"'`;
// Use [ "xACTUAL" = "xLITERAL" ] so empty substitution doesn't retrigger =-as-operator.
```

Apply: any code that builds `docker exec sh -lc` or `ssh host "..."` strings.
Always sanity-check WHERE each subshell `$(...)` will execute.

### §1.4 — `grep` with paths containing special chars

```sh
# WRONG — keyData has /+= chars, breaks regex interpretation
grep -q "$keyData" /file

# RIGHT — fixed-string match
grep -qF "$keyData" /file
```

---

## §2 — "Bun doesn't typecheck → boot crashes on missing exports"

`apps/api` runs `bun run src/index.ts` directly. No compile step. **A missing or unresolved
export takes the production container down at boot.** Local dev hides this because nothing
forces the full module graph to resolve.

```ts
// Suna's incident: packages/db barrel re-exported tables by NAME (not `export *`).
// Someone added authors/authorSources/sourceChunks/agentAuthors to the schema
// but forgot the barrel re-export. tsc would have caught it. Docker build didn't run tsc.
// → api crashed at boot in prod: "Export named 'sourceChunks' not found"
```

**Fix pattern**:
1. CI `ci-build.yml` runs `bun build apps/api/src/index.ts --outdir /tmp/_check` on every PR.
   `bun build` resolves the entire module graph and fails on link errors — it's a boot-safety
   gate without doing full typecheck (the API has ~36 tolerated pre-existing type errors).
2. **Do NOT use `tsc --noEmit` on `apps/api`** — too noisy, would block every PR.
3. When adding a new table / type / function to `packages/*`, update the barrel export
   in the same commit.

`apps/web` is different: `next build` does run, and `typescript.ignoreBuildErrors: true`
means types are ignored at build but the bundler still link-checks. Missing exports there
fail the build directly.

---

## §3 — Writing files into the wrong runtime boundary

Suna's most catastrophic single bug: writing a workspace tool that imported a module the
workspace runtime couldn't resolve. The unhandled rejection **aborted every agent's
response**. No agent in the workspace could reply.

```ts
// WRONG — wrote .opencode/tool/*.ts that does:
import { plugin } from '@opencode-ai/plugin';
// The workspace runtime cannot resolve @opencode-ai/plugin → unhandled rejection
// → all agent replies abort

// RIGHT — choose the right surface:
// - The runtime image's tools/ directory (built into kortix/computer)
// - An MCP server
// - A self-contained tool with `import` only of node builtins + env via process.env
```

**Mental model**: there are 3 distinct execution boundaries in this codebase:

| Boundary | Available imports | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Workspace** (`.opencode/tool/*.ts` written to a sandbox at runtime) | Node builtins + `process.env` only | per-agent custom tools |
| **Runtime image** (`core/kortix-master/opencode/tools/`) | Anything bundled into `kortix/computer` | canonical OpenCode tools |
| **API / web** (`apps/api/src/`, `apps/web/src/`) | `@kortix/shared`, `@kortix/db`, npm deps | normal app code |

Before writing a file, ask: which boundary does this execute in, and which imports survive there?

---

## §4 — `ensureRunning` / "recover" functions on read-ish paths

```ts
// Suna's incident: setupJustavpsSSH() awaited provider.ensureRunning(externalId).
// ensureRunning ran recoverHostWorkload(): systemctl restart justavps-docker +
//   three wait loops (240s each) × 20 retries = worst case ~1 hour.
// → SSH key injection (a READ-ish operation) force-restarted the workload every click.
// → flaky daemon? Sandbox appeared "off" to users.
```

**Pattern to avoid**: don't call heavy "ensure healthy" recovery from paths that just
need a healthy container to already exist. Check `machine.status === 'ready'` cheaply,
then do the actual work with a bounded retry loop. Reserve `ensureRunning` for
explicit recovery endpoints and admin queues.

---

## §5 — Schemas / enums diverging between layers

```ts
// Suna's incident: Zod schema accepted ENV_MODE: 'local' | 'cloud'
// docker-compose.yml had ENV_MODE=production
// → app rejected config at boot
```

When you change an enum / Zod schema / DB column with a CHECK, **grep the whole repo**
for every place the old value appears: docker-compose, k8s manifests, CI env, .env.example,
client-side validators, tests, Caddyfile, deploy-* workflows.

Other instance of this pattern in Suna: PDF text extraction yielded NUL bytes + UTF-16
lone surrogates that Postgres TEXT rejects. The schema accepted "text"; the data wasn't
actually text. Sanitize at the boundary.

---

## §6 — Tab / route / page renderers driven by a map you didn't update

```ts
// Suna's incident: PAGE_COMPONENTS map had /agents → WorkspacePage
// (a speculative leftover from when /agents was just an anticipated route).
// New /agents page was added but never wired into the map.
// → clicking the sidebar Agents entry showed Workspace ("Novo agente"), nav appeared broken.
```

When adding a route or tab, search for the routing map (often a single `Record<string, …>`
in a registry file like `menu-registry.ts` or `PAGE_COMPONENTS`) and update it in the
**same commit** as the route addition.

### §6.1 — A new DYNAMIC `(dashboard)` route needs THREE registrations, not one (D-022)

Shipped this in the multi-project restore. The `(dashboard)` group is a TAB SYSTEM: the
catch-all + `layout-content.tsx` decide what to render via `resolveTabFromPathname()`, and
tab content is rendered by `PageTabContent` → `resolveComponent(href)` (a map of href → lazy
component). A bare Next `page.tsx` is NOT enough — adding `app/(dashboard)/projects/[id]/page.tsx`
alone gave a literal **"Page not found"** (from `PageTabContent` when `resolveComponent`
returns null) even though the route built fine and the page existed.

A new dynamic `(dashboard)` route needs all THREE, in the same commit:
1. `app/(dashboard)/<route>/[id]/page.tsx` — the page. Read params as a **PROP via `use()`**
   (`function Page({ params }: { params?: Promise<{id}> }) { const {id}=use(params)... }`),
   NOT `useParams()` — `PageTabContent` renders it as `<Component params={promise}/>`, not as
   the matched route, so `useParams()` is empty. Mirror `app/(dashboard)/tasks/[id]/page.tsx`.
2. `lib/tab-route-resolver.ts` — a dynamic resolver matching `/^\/<route>\/([^/]+)$/`
   returning a `TabDescriptor` (`type: 'page'`).
3. `components/tabs/page-tab-content.tsx` — a lazy import + a `resolveComponent` case
   returning `{ Component, params: { id } }`.

Static routes only need the `PAGE_COMPONENTS` + `STATIC_TAB_ROUTES` entries. Symptom of a
miss: the page works as a file but the app shows "Page not found" on direct load **and** on
sidebar click.

---

## §7 — Happy-path features that forget existing data

Repeated Suna pattern: ship a feature for new objects, forget about objects that pre-exist.

- "Authors are now also agents" → existing authors had no agent → had to add a "Criar agente" action + auto-provision retry path.
- Creating an agent → didn't invalidate the agents react-query → new agent didn't show in selector until a hard reload.
- Magic-link auth set as default → SMTP wasn't configured → no one could sign in → had to flip to password auth as default.

When shipping a feature, ask: (a) what happens for objects created BEFORE this feature?
(b) what client-side caches need invalidation? (c) does this depend on an env / service
that isn't configured in prod?

---

## §8 — Wrong CI gate (too noisy → ignored; or wrong tool for the check)

```yaml
# Suna shipped tsc --noEmit on apps/api — 36 pre-existing tolerated errors,
# never green, blocked every PR → had to be reverted.
# Replacement: bun build --outdir (resolves graph without typechecking).

# Then: bun build --outfile failed because graph has dynamic-import split points
# → multi-chunk output → --outfile doesn't accept that. Switch to --outdir.
```

Pick the CI gate that catches the actual bug you care about. For `apps/api`:
- ❌ `tsc --noEmit` — too noisy, blocks unrelated PRs.
- ❌ `bun build --outfile` — fails on multi-chunk graphs.
- ✅ `bun build --outdir` — resolves the graph, fails on missing exports, doesn't typecheck.

---

## §9 — Wasted CI: rebuild everything every push

```yaml
# Suna shipped a deploy that rebuilt BOTH api AND frontend on every push to main.
# Frontend build ~4min → wasted on backend-only PRs.
# Fix: dorny/paths-filter job, gate build-api / build-frontend on which paths changed.
```

ymagineApp's `deploy-dev.yml` already does this. `deploy-hostinger.yml` should too —
audit it next time you touch it.

---

## §10 — Deploy-time secrets / keys pasted in chat

```
# Suna's OPENROUTER_API_KEY was pasted into a chat once → forever marked for rotation in
# decisions.md. The whole-key value lived briefly in someone's transcript log.
```

If you need a secret value to debug:
- Ask the operator to paste it directly into the VPS file (`nano /root/.kortix/.env`), not into the chat.
- If a secret is accidentally pasted to chat, record it in `decisions.md` so it gets rotated next session.

---

## §11 — Assuming infra topology instead of checking it (D-022)

Burned hours this session assuming the prod sandbox ran on JustAVPS (the cloud path). It
does NOT: the Hostinger self-hosted deploy runs the sandbox as a **LOCAL docker container**
(`kortix-hosted-sandbox`, provider `local_docker`) ON the VPS — `docker ps` shows it next to
api/frontend/supabase. Before reasoning about sandbox/deploy, CHECK:
- `apps/api/src/config.ts` → `ALLOWED_SANDBOX_PROVIDERS` (this deploy = `local_docker`) and `SANDBOX_IMAGE`.
- `docker ps` on the VPS — is the sandbox a local container or remote?

Three deploy truths learned here (corrects/extends `architecture.md`):
- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` is BUILD-TIME** — baked into the JS bundle by `next build`. You cannot
  flip it via `docker exec`/runtime env; it needs a frontend rebuild (the flag lives in
  `deploy-hostinger.yml`'s build step). Don't try to "fix" a `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` flag on the host.
- **`core/` does NOT deploy via `deploy-hostinger`** (its paths are apps/api, apps/web,
  packages, supabase, the workflow). The sandbox image is a separate pipeline. The fork CAN
  build its OWN sandbox image to **GHCR with the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`** — no Docker Hub
  creds — via `.github/workflows/build-sandbox-image.yml`, then point the api's `SANDBOX_IMAGE`
  at `ghcr.io/<owner>/ymagineapp-computer:<tag>`. (deploy-dev builds `kortix/computer` too but
  its Docker Hub creds were missing + its frontend build OOMs — abandoned path.)
- The sandbox `/workspace` is a **named volume** (`kortix-sandbox-data`) → recreating the
  container on a new image PRESERVES user data. `docker rm` (without `-v`) keeps it.

### §11.1 — Secrets in shell commands + logs (security review caught this)

When building a `docker login`/exec command with a token: **shell-escape** the value (use
`shellEscape()` from justavps.ts; for dockerode pull pass `authconfig`, not a command string)
AND **never log the raw error** (`console.warn(..., err)`) — it can carry the token-bearing
command. Use `--password-stdin`; log a sanitized message only. Gotcha: `/root/.docker/config.json`'s
`ghcr.io` auth may be a STALE CI `GITHUB_TOKEN` from a deploy's `docker login` (~400 chars),
NOT the operator's PAT — don't extract it expecting a ~40-char PAT.

---

## §12 — Tightening what data is shown without backfilling that data = a regression (D-023)

Shipped a new sandbox image carrying upstream `eb32a2c08` (per-project session scoping) WITHOUT
migrating the data it relies on. The OLD image always resolved `/:id/sessions` to the global
project, so EVERY project showed ALL sessions (looked full). The "more correct" scoping made
every sub-folder project's Sessions tab go **empty** — read by the user as "it broke." Same
class as §7, but for behaviour that *narrows* a result set (scoping / filtering / RLS / a stricter
`WHERE`): **ship the data backfill in the SAME change**, or "more correct + empty" reads as a
regression.

### §12.1 — There is NO structural per-project signal for sandbox sessions

Every OpenCode session in the self-hosted sandbox shares ONE `projectID` and runs in
`directory: "/workspace"` — the "projects" (`watson`, `the-big-1`, …) are **sub-folders**, not
separate OpenCode projects. So `projectID` / `directory` / `opencode_id` are identical across all
sessions and distinguish nothing. The only reliable signal is **which files the session touched**:
scan `/session/:id/message` for the dominant `/workspace/<folder>/` prefix (≥10 refs) and map
`<folder>` → kortix project by path. See [[decisions]] D-023.

### §12.2 — `session_projects` is one-project-per-session; never clobber a sub-project link

PK is `session_id` (one row per session). Backfill + auto-link MUST:
- **Only (re)assign sessions linked to the root/global project** — NEVER move a session already on
  a sub-project. That single rule preserves both auto-classifications AND manual corrections.
- The file heuristic IS fallible: a session titled *"The Big One consulting team"* referenced
  `/workspace/watson` 2440× → actually belonged to `the-big-1` (the human reassigned it). The
  human's word overrides the files; the never-move-sub-project rule is what makes the fix stick.
- The global-view backfill must claim only **UNLINKED** sessions. The original code
  `INSERT OR REPLACE`d every session not linked to global → loading the global Sessions view
  **clobbered** every sub-project link. Check "linked to ANY project", not "linked to THIS one".

### §12.3 — `bun:sqlite` write open

```ts
// WRONG — throws SQLiteError: bad parameter or other API misuse (SQLITE_MISUSE)
const db = new Database(path, { readonly: false })
// RIGHT — default is read-write+create; only pass an option to RESTRICT
const db = MODE === 'APPLY' ? new Database(path) : new Database(path, { readonly: true })
```

## §13 — VPS sandbox-image deploy: disk + GHCR login

### §13.1 — The root disk is full; prune before every sandbox pull

The 96G VPS root sits at ~100% (each `ymagineapp-computer` image is ~20GB; a few tags = 60GB+).
`docker pull <new sandbox tag>` then dies mid-extract: `write ... : no space left on device`.
Run `docker image prune -a -f` FIRST — it keeps images used by RUNNING containers (the current
`SANDBOX_IMAGE` + the 6 compose services stay), reclaimed ~52GB here. Keep ≥1 prior tag for
rollback; api/frontend rollback re-pulls from GHCR anyway.

**Routine GC is now automated (2026-06-01):** a daily VPS cron (`/root/docker-prune.sh`, 04:00 UTC)
runs `docker image prune -af --filter until=168h` — keeps in-use + <7d images, removes older unused
tags. So the disk no longer creeps to 100% on its own; the manual `prune -a -f` above is only the
fallback if a fresh ~20GB pull still hits disk before the cron has aged out the old tags. Details +
policy in the gitignored `deploy-runbook.md` (Disk hygiene §).

### §13.2 — GHCR daemon login expires → `pull ... denied`

`docker pull` of the private `ymagineapp-computer` returns `error from registry: denied` even
when a prior pull worked (the image was just cached locally, so no auth was exercised). The daemon
isn't logged in. Re-login on the VPS using creds ALREADY in `/root/.kortix/.env` — never paste a
token in chat (§10/§11.1):

```sh
GU=$(grep -E '^GHCR_PULL_USER='  /root/.kortix/.env | head -1 | cut -d= -f2-)
GT=$(grep -E '^GHCR_PULL_TOKEN=' /root/.kortix/.env | head -1 | cut -d= -f2-)
printf '%s' "$GT" | docker login ghcr.io -u "$GU" --password-stdin   # token stays on the VPS
```

## §14 — SSH access from the start, and verifying the real diff

### §14.1 — Have prod SSH ready at session start (this cost time)

- The temp key is `~/.ssh/vps_temp` — NOT `~/.ssh/claude-temp`. `claude-temp` is the pubkey
  *label* in the VPS `authorized_keys`, not the private-key filename. (See `deploy-runbook.md`.)
- The auto-mode classifier **blocks** `ssh root@<host>` to prod until the user authorizes it
  **in words** — pasting a control-panel screenshot or a pubkey is NOT enough. Operator: at the
  start of any deploy session, pre-authorize the `ssh ... root@<host>` Bash rule (or just say "you
  can SSH") so deploy work doesn't stall mid-task waiting for a permission.
- Connect with `-o BatchMode=yes -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new -o ConnectTimeout=15`; feed
  remote scripts via a `'sh -s' <<'REMOTE'` heredoc on stdin — sidesteps the §1.3 quoting minefield.

### §14.2 — Trust `git diff`, not `gh pr merge`'s file summary

`gh pr merge` reported "22 files / 1010 insertions" for a 3-file PR, because the PR base was a
local merge commit whose tree equalled remote `main`. Don't panic at the summary — confirm what a
merge actually adds with `git diff <prev-main-sha>..origin/main --stat` (here it was exactly the 3
intended files).

### §14.3 — Don't render the empty state during load

```tsx
// WRONG — flashes "Nenhuma sessão" for the whole (slow) fetch, looks like "no data"
const { data = [] } = useQuery(...)
if (list.length === 0) return <Empty/>
// RIGHT — gate on isLoading first
const { data = [], isLoading } = useQuery(...)
if (isLoading && !list.length) return <Loader/>
```
Bit us when `?usage=1` made the sessions fetch ~10× slower (0.1s → 1.2s).

---

## §15 — Team tab empty / "I built a team" but it's invisible (D-024)

Two unrelated "agents": **Board team agents** = `project_agents` DB rows (the Team tab + the board
read these; created via Team tab → New agent, or `seedV2Project`). **OpenCode session agents** =
`.opencode/agent/*.md` files. An LLM writing agent FILES into a project (even a full team) creates
session-agents the Board never sees — and that OpenCode (cwd `/workspace`) often never loads, and
that may point at a dead model (e.g. removed `kortix-yolo`, D-020). Plus: the boot v1→v2 migration
flips `structure_version=2` WITHOUT seeding → "zombie v2" (0 columns, 0 agents). If the Team tab is
empty or a hand-built team "won't run": you want a **Board team agent (DB row)** — seed the project
or use the Team tab. Full design + model-routing → `stack/agents.md`. Fix → [[decisions]] D-024.

## §16 — Optimizing the wrong layer: measure the hop budget before "make it faster" (D-025)

A "make it faster" request invites optimizing whatever looks worst in the code (here: a SQLite N+1,
missing indexes, `journal_mode=DELETE`). DON'T — first measure WHERE the time actually is. A read-only
harness (2026-06-01, `icm/output/perf/`) showed the ymagineApp VPS is in **Boston** and the operator
in **Brazil**: one round-trip is **~141ms** (ICMP, measured), while the entire server answers a board
read in **~4ms** and SQLite is sub-millisecond. So the DB "defects" save microseconds invisible next
to one Atlantic crossing — the real bottleneck is network **round-trip COUNT**. Fix THAT
(prefetch-on-hover → warm FRESH cache; don't block first paint on a slow payload; less initial JS),
not the DB. The DB batches were DEFERRED as premature at 4-ticket scale (same trap as gold-plating
indexes on an empty table). Rules: (1) for perf work, build a tiny hop-budget harness FIRST; never
optimize a layer you haven't measured; (2) ~50ms cold is physically impossible across an ocean (1 RTT
= 2.8× the budget) — say so honestly, and reach for warm-cache navigation (real data prefetched, NOT
a skeleton) as the legitimate path. Fix → [[decisions]] D-025.

---

## §17 — PostgreSQL REVOKE from named roles is a silent no-op when PUBLIC still has the grant

**What happened (2026-06-02):** Pentest found 5 billing RPCs callable via PostgREST anon key.
Migration `00000000000032` was written to `REVOKE EXECUTE … FROM anon, authenticated` — shipped,
merged, applied to prod. Verification showed `has_function_privilege('anon', …, 'execute') = t`
— still TRUE. Live PostgREST call still returned `{"reason":"account_not_found"}` instead of
`42501 permission denied`. The REVOKE was a silent no-op.

**Root cause:** `CREATE FUNCTION` in PostgreSQL grants `EXECUTE` to `PUBLIC` by default.
Roles `anon` and `authenticated` inherit via `PUBLIC`, so revoking from the named roles
while `PUBLIC` still holds the grant has zero effect. The `information_schema.role_routine_grants`
table showed `PUBLIC | EXECUTE` on all 5 functions — the named-role revoke only removes a
*direct* grant; it cannot override the inherited PUBLIC one.

**Fix:** Always `REVOKE EXECUTE FROM PUBLIC` first, then optionally re-grant to specific roles:
```sql
-- WRONG — no-op if PUBLIC still has it:
REVOKE EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.f(...) FROM anon, authenticated;

-- CORRECT — removes the inherited path too:
REVOKE EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.f(...) FROM PUBLIC, anon, authenticated;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.f(...) TO service_role;  -- re-grant explicitly
```

**Also note:** `has_function_privilege('anon', 'f(...)', 'execute')` returns `t` even after
revoking from `anon` if PUBLIC still holds the grant — the check resolves transitively. Use
`information_schema.role_routine_grants` or `pg_proc` `proacl` to see the actual grant list.

**Pre-commit check:** Any migration with `REVOKE EXECUTE` → always include `FROM PUBLIC` and
verify with `SELECT grantee FROM information_schema.role_routine_grants WHERE routine_name = 'f'`
before declaring done. Fix → [[decisions]] D-027.

---

## §18 — Supabase self-hosted migrations are NOT applied by deploy-hostinger

**What happened (2026-06-02, same incident):** Migration file was created, merged to `main`, CI
passed, `deploy-hostinger` succeeded — but the REVOKE had no effect because the SQL was never
executed against the running database. It took a manual `psql` session inside the container to
actually apply it.

**Root cause:** `deploy-hostinger.yml` builds and deploys Docker images for `apps/api` and
`apps/web`. It does NOT run `supabase db push` or any migration step against the self-hosted
Supabase. Migrations in `supabase/migrations/` are applied only:
- Locally via `supabase db reset`
- On self-hosted prod via manual `docker exec kortix-supabase-db-1 psql -U postgres -f …`

**Rule:** Any security-critical or data-shape-changing migration MUST be verified on prod with a
query that checks the DB state (not just "CI passed"). For REVOKE: check
`information_schema.role_routine_grants`. For schema changes: check `\d table`. For RLS: check
`pg_policies`. A green deploy pipeline is a code delivery gate, NOT a DB state gate on
self-hosted Supabase.

**Pre-commit check (added to checklist below):** Any `supabase/migrations/` file that is
security-critical → add a follow-up task: "apply + verify on prod DB before declaring done".
Fix → [[decisions]] D-027.

## §19 — A provider/feature "disappearing" after a deploy: check credential + boot-timing BEFORE blaming your change (D-026)

I added ONE `provider.openrouter` block to opencode.jsonc and openai+google vanished from the model
list (4→2 providers). I concluded my config broke it + rolled back. **WRONG.** opencode v1.14.28
has NO allowlist rule — a config block CANNOT drop other providers (verified line-by-line in
`provider.ts`: the env/auth loops iterate the whole models.dev database with only a
`disabled_providers` guard; no `cfg.provider`-non-empty gate). The real cause was
**CREDENTIAL/boot-timing**: opencode lists a provider only when it finds a credential — an ENV key
(launcher exports ANTHROPIC/OPENAI/OPENROUTER, now +GOOGLE) OR an `auth.json` `{type:"api"}` entry.
On the recreate's boot, the s6-env sync hadn't populated the keys yet AND google's `auth.json` (its
ONLY listing path — fragile; auth-sync can clear it) was absent → fewer providers listed. It
self-healed once the sync caught up. Lessons: (1) when something vanishes after a deploy, snapshot
the CREDENTIAL/runtime state (which env keys are present? which auth.json entries?) BEFORE assuming
the code diff caused it — correlation with a recreate is often boot-timing, not the diff; (2) read
the ACTUAL source for the rule you're theorizing about (the "config allowlist" rule never existed);
(3) opencode storage lives on `/workspace` via the `/persistent → /workspace/.persistent-system`
symlink (persisted), NOT ephemeral. Fix → [[decisions]] D-026.

- [ ] Is the CI gate appropriate for what you actually want to catch? (§8)
- [ ] Are any secret values in your diff, in a shell command, or in a log line? (§10, §11.1)
- [ ] Reasoning about sandbox/deploy? → checked `ALLOWED_SANDBOX_PROVIDERS` + `docker ps` on the VPS; remember `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` is build-time and `core/` ships via the sandbox image, not `deploy-hostinger` (§11)
- [ ] Shipping behaviour that NARROWS a result set (scope/filter/RLS)? → backfill the existing data in the SAME change (§12, §7)
- [ ] Writing a `REVOKE EXECUTE` migration? → did you include `FROM PUBLIC`? Verify with `information_schema.role_routine_grants` on prod, not just CI (§17)
- [ ] Any `supabase/migrations/` file that is security-critical? → manual `psql` apply + verify on prod DB; `deploy-hostinger` does NOT run migrations (§18)
- [ ] Writing a `core/` data script to `kortix.db`? → bun:sqlite write = `new Database(path)` (not `{readonly:false}`); never move a session already on a sub-project (§12.2)
- [ ] Deploying a sandbox image? → `docker image prune -a -f` first (disk full); re-`docker login ghcr.io` from the VPS `.env` token if pull says `denied` (§13)
- [ ] About to SSH to prod? → key is `~/.ssh/vps_temp`; needs explicit user authorization (classifier blocks it otherwise); feed scripts via `'sh -s' <<'REMOTE'` (§14)
- [ ] Frontend list with a slow fetch? → gate on `isLoading` before the empty state (§14.3)
- [ ] Trimming L0 by delegating routing/refs to L1? → confirm L1 actually covers EVERYTHING you removed BEFORE merging (Stage 08 fell out of routing this way — #19 shipped the gap, #20 fixed it)
- [ ] Creating/expecting agents that work the Board? → they must be `project_agents` rows (Team tab → New agent, or `seed-v2`), NOT hand-written `.opencode/agent` files; seed an unconfigured model = dead agent (§15, `stack/agents.md`)
- [ ] Asked to "make it faster"? → measure the hop budget (RTT vs server vs DB) with a read-only harness FIRST; never optimize a layer you haven't measured. RTT often dwarfs the server (Boston↔Brazil ≈ 141ms vs ~4ms server) → fix round-trip count / prefetch, not the DB (§16, D-025)
- [ ] A provider/model/feature "disappeared" after a sandbox deploy? → snapshot credential + boot-timing state (env keys present? auth.json entries?) BEFORE blaming your diff. opencode lists providers by credential; env-sync can lag the boot; no config-allowlist rule exists. Adding effort? opencode `variant` mechanism, per-model, synthesized for most — only grok-type OpenRouter models need config variants (§19, D-026)
